##Summary:

The CNC Machine is a system that can be used not only by manufacturers but also by small scale shops. It has been designed with these features:
- Microcontroller system to send and receive information 
- Driver system to run machine at desired specifications 
- Mechanical system to support weight of gantry while in motion or idle plus the weight of the attached tool heads & handle deflection. 

This machine should display these characteristics 
- Multiple forms of communication either through parallel port, Ethernet, or USB.
- Multiple tool heads for different applications including milling and plasma cutting. 
- Accepts multiple types of files.
- Able to move at high speeds.
- Longer working life compared to other relative machines.
- Inexpensive & repeatable to produce.
- Easy to assemble, operate, and maintain 

This document contains all relevant material concerning the design of the entire machine. The report will be broken down into these sections 
- Overall description of system 
- Sub-system design and selection
- Cost Estimate 
- Implementation Schedule 
- Conclusion with discussion of design
