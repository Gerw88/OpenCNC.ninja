##Introduction

The goal is to design and build a multi-function CNC profiling system with a cutting area of 2.44m x 1.22m x 0.15m.  The intent is to design the entire system with a minimum cost, while providing a positional accuracy of +/- 0.05 mm (.002‚Äù), and high machining speeds of up to 15 m per minute. The basis of the design will be patterned after numerous CNC Router designs (namely but not limited to, Data-Cut CNC, ShopBot Alpha, JoesCNC Evolution & MechMate). The design should incorporate interchangeable profiling heads & beds to support the profiling of both metal (using a Plasma head with Torch Height Control (THC)) and wood/non-ferrous metal/ aluminium and plastics utilizing a 2.2 -3.0KW single phase motor.

The system must cater for the occasional break-down and reassembly for relocation purposes.
